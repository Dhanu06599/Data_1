The advantages of Spring Boot are listed below:

Easy to understand and develop spring applications.
Spring Boot is nothing but an existing framework annotation configuration which makes it easier to understand and faster the process of development.
Increases productivity and reduces development time.
Minimum configuration.
We don’t need to write any XML configuration, only a few annotations are required to do the configuration.

the four key components of spring-boot:

Spring Boot auto-configuration.
Spring Boot CLI.
Spring Boot starter POMs.
Spring Boot Actuators

Why Spring Boot over Spring?
Starter POM.
Version Management.
Auto Configuration.
Component Scanning.
Embedded server.
InMemory DB.
Actuators


What is the starter dependency of the Spring boot module?
Spring boot provides numbers of starter dependency, here are the most commonly used -

Data JPA starter.
Test Starter.
Security starter.
Web starter.
Mail starter.
Thymeleaf starter

How does Spring Boot works?
Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using annotation.

@SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
Spring Boot enables the developer to use a single annotation instead of using multiple.
Spring provided loosely coupled features.

What is the purpose of using @ComponentScan in the class files?
Spring Boot automatically scans all the components included in the project by using @ComponentScan annotation.

How does a spring boot application get started?
Just like any other Java program, a Spring Boot application must have a main method. 
This method serves as an entry point, which invokes the SpringApplication#run method to start the application.
ex: we need to import spring-boot-starter-web dependency for creating a web application = starter dependency

Spring Initializer is a web application that helps you to create an initial spring boot project structure to build your code.
It solves the problem of setting up a framework when you are starting a project from scratch.

What is Spring Boot CLI and what are its benefits?
Spring Boot CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to create a spring-based java application using Groovy.
Example: You don’t need to create getter and setter method or access modifier, return statement. 
If you use the JDBC template, it automatically loads for you.


@EnableAutoConfiguration – to make Spring Boot look for auto-configuration beans on its classpath and automatically apply them.
@SpringBootApplication – used to denote the main class of a Boot Application. 
This annotation combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.

Spring Boot dependency management is used to manage dependencies and configuration automatically:  What is Spring Boot dependency management?

The default port of the tomcat server-id 8080. It can be changed by adding sever.port properties in the application.property file.

Yes, we can override or replace the Embedded Tomcat server with any server by using the Starter dependency in the pom.xml file.

Is it possible to change the port of the embedded Tomcat server in Spring Boot?
Yes, it is possible. By using the server.port in the application.properties

Can we disable the default web server in the Spring boot application?
Yes, we can use application.properties to configure the web application type i.e spring.main.web-application-type=none.

Explain @RestController annotation in Sprint boot?
It is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody, used for creating a restful controller. 
It converts the response to JSON or XML. It ensures that data returned by each method will be written straight into the response body.

@Controller Map of the model object to view or template and make it human readable 
but @RestController simply returns the object and object data is directly written in HTTP response as JSON or XML

RequestMapping can be used with GET, POST, PUT, and many other request methods using the method attribute on the annotation. 
Whereas getMapping is only an extension of RequestMapping which helps you to improve on clarity on request.


An actuator is an additional feature of Spring that helps you to monitor and manage your application when you push it to production. 
These actuators include auditing, health, CPU usage, HTTP hits, and metric gathering, and many more that are automatically applied to your application.
To enable the spring actuator feature, we need to add the dependency of “spring-boot-starter-actuator” in pom.xml.

What is an IOC container?
IoC Container is a framework for implementing automatic dependency injection.
It manages object creation and also injects dependencies into the class.

Where do we define properties in the Spring Boot application?
You can define both application and Spring boot-related properties into a file called application.properties. 
You can create this file manually or use Spring Initializer to create this file. 
You don’t need to do any special configuration to instruct Spring Boot to load this file, If it exists in classpath then spring boot automatically loads it 


The process of injecting dependent bean objects into target bean objects is called dependency injection.

Setter Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by calling the setter method.
Constructor Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by calling the target bean constructor.
Field Injection: The IOC container will inject the dependent bean object into the target bean object by Reflection API.

Suppose class One needs the object of class Two to instantiate or operate a method, then class One is said to be dependent on class Two. 
Now though it might appear okay to depend a module on the other but, in the real world, this could lead to a lot of problems, including system failure. 
Hence such dependencies need to be avoided.
IOC resolves such dependencies with Dependency Injection, which makes the code easier to test and reuse.

Dependency Injection is the main functionality provided by Spring IOC(Inversion of Control).
The Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods. 
The design principle of Inversion of Control emphasizes keeping the Java classes independent of each other and the container frees them from object creation and maintenance.
Dependency Injection in Spring also ensures loose-coupling between the classes.

key feature of Spring is dependency injection 
Spring framework helps to create a loosely coupled application.
Spring framework does not provide support for the in-memory database
such as H2. (opp in springboot)
Spring framework requires too many lines of code  even for minimal tasks.
(opp in springboot)
In the Spring framework, you have to build configurations manually.
In the Spring framework, XML Configuration is required.	                      No need for XML configuration in Spring Boot.
Testing in Spring is difficult.	                                  Testing in Spring Boot is easier due to the reduced amount of source code.
                                                                   Spring Boot helps in saving time, and reducing efforts by

Can I use spring MVC with spring boot?
Yes, you can use Spring MVC with Spring Boot. To create and run a Spring MVC web application in spring boot, 
you need to add the spring-boot-starter dependency in your pom.xml file. 

Spring Actuator is an interesting feature of Spring Boot. It allows you to see what is happening inside a running application.

DispatcherServlet class  is the front controller of Spring MVC. 
required to specify the DispatcherServlet class in the web.xml file.
===========================================================================================================================================
Spring mvc:

Spring MVC is a Model, View, and Controller based framework used to build web applications.
This framework requires a lot of configurations, such as DispatcherServlet configurations and View Resolver configurations
Spring MVC helps to develop applications easily.
A deployment descriptor is required for the Spring MVC framework
The four components of Spring MVC are Model, View, Controller, and Front Controller (DispatcherServlet class).
It is necessary to build the configuration manually if we are using Spring MVC.
The Spring MVC framework requires more time for development.
